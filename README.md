# Getting Started - DIY Telemetry Device Setup Instructions

There are three distinct device types you can construct, each potentially requiring a varied component list depending on your chosen design. You have the option to procure all the components independently or opt for our DIY kit, available for shipment upon request from team@racetrackhero.com.

You can obtain these separate components yourself, or through [Racetrack Hero](https://www.racetrackhero.com/resources).
All device types require an SD card. We recommend download a complete Racetrack Hero image from the [Racetrack Hero's website](https://www.racetrackhero.com/resources).

## Headless Device
The easiest and simplest to build. Perfect for data collection and live streaming of your driving on a race track.

### Hardware Components

1. Rasbperry Pi zero W 2. 
2. [Berry GPS-IMU V4](https://ozzmaker.com/product/berrygps-imu). You can also obtain different GPS hats which might be already compatible with this software (look at GPS hat drivers in "./libs/gps" directory).
3. GPS Antenna - 32db High Gain Cirocomm 5cm Active GPS Antenna Ceramic Antenna 25x25x2mm Geekstory.
4. ZTE MF833V 4G LTE USB Modem Dongle for data.
5. Case - UniPiCase Pi Zero Case - Tall (Stock Faceplate)
6. [Suction Cup](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YJJSCLX?psc=1&ref=product_details)
7. Mini USB to USB and USB angled connector for your ZTE 4G LTE Modem.

### Assembly
1. Install the Berry GPS hat onto the Raspberry Pi0. Soldering is required for getting the hat attached to it.
